## You are not authorized to install Standup & Prosper

Standup & Prosper must be installed in your workspace. However you probably already have installed, but for some reason you are still getting this screen:

The reason you are getting this is because, contratry to the error message, your workspace as blocked your access to login with Slack. That means even though the bot is already installed, your workspace will not allow us to verify you have access to our bot.

## Solution
Ask one of your **Slack** Workspace Admin to enable this feature in your workspace: https://slack.com/apps/manage/settings

Once, that setting has been enabled, you will be able to login and access to the Standup Portal.
