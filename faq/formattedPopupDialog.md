## Q: How to paste formatted markdown into report dialog?
The standup popup dialog doesn't allow preformatted text, even though we have requested from Slack to allow this multiple times. There is just no way to support it, these fields only support markdown.

#### Why is preformatted even necessary?

In some cases standup team members may want to copy their previous day's standup answers to today. In those cases rather than manually copying and pasting, there is a great automated solution that exists to solve this problem. Just enable the **Autofill prepopulation** and Standup & Prosper will take care of the rest. Answers will be automatically populated into the dialog the next day **in markdown**, making it easy for your team members to edit their responses.

#### I still want preformatted text
That's no problem, preformatted text can already be pasted directly to the bot in a standup conversation. Just take the response and paste it directly in the chat box. What you see here is what Standup & Prosper will send back to the team at report time.

## One last thing!

We still want to support this feature, and so we've asked Slack to implement it, but they haven't yet. But you can too!

We promise to support emojis and rich text in the popup dialog as soon as Slack supports it. You can help make this happen by directly asking Slack for a **Rich Text Input Element** [Here](https://slack.com/help/requests/new).
