## Advanced Scheduling:
Your standups can be scheduled fortnightly and monthly instead of only weekly. Additionally, you'll get the ability to specify complex recurring patterns such as future start dates and to the minute start times for your startups. Normally there is only a short list to select from. For the Community plan we optimize for sufficient for most teams, however, some teams have unique needs that don't fit into our Community plan.

## Answer autofill:
There are two parts to this. The first part is an automatic copy from yesterday. Lots of standups include the question what did you do yesterday. When this setting is enabled, Standup & Prosper will automatically prepopulate that question from what was filled out in yesterday's standup. And you can enable configuration for any type of question. The second part of the feature applies when filling out a standup, your team members can select to copy the answers from another standup. Sometimes a team member is in multiple standups and wants to report part or all of their report to another standup. On the paid plan this capability is enabled by default.

## Advanced reporting:
This is sort of hard to explain, there is a Standup Report Dashboard available in the Standup & Prosper Portal. From there you'll be able to filter, sort, and review your standup history. Some teams prefer this screen to what is posted in Slack depending on their workflow. Since you are now on the trial, it might be easiest to fill out a report and then go to the portal to see what it looks like.

## Dynamic Question Pools:
With Question Pools you'll be able to enter a list of automatically rotating questions into a list using the Standup Portal configuration. And when your standup runs for the day it will pull questions from the pool as configured. You can configure one, some, or all the questions to come from the pool. Everyone on the team will answer the same questions, and then the next day the questions will rotate. This enables teams to add in health-check related questions or more general ice-breaker like questions.

## Data Retention:
With the community plan you'll only have access to the last 7 days of standup data. With the paid plan, we store the data for much longer so you can run whatever kind of export you need. The data retention powers both the Standups Report Portal as well as the Standup & Prosper API, in case you choose to get the data from there.

## Prioritized Development
Lastly on the plan, if you find any of these features lacking or something additional that isn't currently part of Standup & Prosper but you would like improved or added, usually we'll prioritize getting it added for your team. There are very few things that we haven't been able to execute on, so please do let us know if you find anything that isn't exactly as you would like.
